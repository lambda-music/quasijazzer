# QUASIJAZZER

In this world, especially in Jazz music scene, it is very difficult to play
with good groove on automatic backing track generators. They very likely play
with less swing.  As you have heard in the famous song "It Don't Mean a Thing
If It Ain't Got That Swing", jazz music without swing feel does not impress
much to audience.

In my analysis, the beats of good groove are multi-layered by two parameters:
the length of the notes, and a classification as on-beat, off-beat; and played
with what I call "drift". This "drift" is not a denominational terminology.
Almost every note in Jazz is played earlier/later than its location where it
should be played if it is written in a music sheet.

It is very important to a good rhythm section to configure the bassist and the
drummer with proper drifts; otherwise their rhythm limits the possibility of
improvisation of the lead players who play on the band.

This application is being written for the proof of the theory, now.

"quasijazzer-band" which includes some patch files and sound fonts, etc.
